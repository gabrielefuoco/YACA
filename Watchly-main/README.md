**Watchly** is a Stremio catalog addon that provides personalized movie and series recommendations based on your Stremio library. It uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API to generate intelligent recommendations from the content you've watched and loved.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Analyzes your Stremio library to understand your viewing preferences.
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically excludes content you've already watched.
- **Advanced Scoring**: Recommendations are intelligently weighted by recency and relevance.
- **Genre-Based Discovery**: Offers genre-specific catalogs based on your viewing history.
- **Similar Content**: Discover content similar to specific titles in your library.
- **Web Configuration**: Easy-to-use web interface for secure setup.
- **Secure Architecture**: Credentials are stored securely and never exposed in URLs.
- **Background Sync**: Keeps your catalogs updated automatically in the background.
- **Performance Optimized**: Intelligent caching for fast and reliable responses.

        container_name: watchly-redis
        restart: unless-stopped
        volumes:
          - redis_data:/data

      watchly:
        image: ghcr.io/timilsinabimal/watchly:latest
        container_name: watchly
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - "8000:8000"
        env_file:
          - .env
        depends_on:
